Hi, I’m Mihir Shah.
I’m interested in the field of Business Intelligence and Analytics. I have had an experience of 2 years as an RM Associate and Analytics after completing my Bachelor's Degree.
I’m currently pursuing my Masters in Information Technology and Analytics at Rutgers Business School.
I’m currently working on a project in the field of Business Forecasting.
We are forecasting demand for a subset of hair care products that are sourced from a distribution center in Whittier, CA. The distribution leads need an accurate forecast to adequately and effectively plan labor for the upcoming months.
The desired output of the forecast will help plan labor for the first half of 2022 (Jan-Jun 2022).
Forecast accuracy will be measured by two metrics mean average deviation (MAD) and mean average percent error (MAPE). The MAD metric will capture how large an error will be on average in the forecast. MAPE will capture how large the forecast is in comparison to demand volume.
The data set is 5 years of historical demand for the subset of haircare products. The time dimension is broken out by year, month, week, day. Simulation data was provided by the marketing team in order to complete this case study.
The github profile of my colleagues working on the project with me are as follows: https://github.com/TJMcDougal/Business-Forecasting
